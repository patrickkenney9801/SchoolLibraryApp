# School Library App
School Library App is a mobile application designed to facilitate the management of any school library. The app was designed to enter the FBLA Mobile Application Development 2018 competition. School Library App acts as a database for all library books, allowing students and teachers to browse or reserve books and librarians to add or check out books. 

## Installation
Using an Android Device:
* Go to the Google Play store
* Search PK9801 and install the application “Books on the Go”

## Passwords for Testing
* New users must create new accounts and they need to join libraries
* Joining libraries requires a password -- the library passwords for all librarians, teachers, and general users are “password” for the CHS and Keller libraries

## Errors
School Library App is functional, as seen by internal usage and testing. If any errors happen to occur, a bug reporting system is integrated into the app.
